# Introduction to NextClaw

**Feature-rich, OpenClaw-compatible · UI-first, lightweight personal AI assistant.**

NextClaw is a personal AI gateway you run locally. You talk to it via the CLI or through messaging channels (Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, Feishu, and more). The web UI is for configuration only: set your default model, AI providers (API keys, base URLs), and message channels. One command, then configure everything in the browser.

## Origins

Inspired by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) and [nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot), NextClaw keeps OpenClaw’s plugin and channel ecosystem while using a smaller codebase and a UI-first workflow. Code size is tracked daily against OpenClaw (see [code volume metrics](https://github.com/Peiiii/nextclaw/blob/master/docs/metrics/code-volume/comparison.json)); NextClaw is roughly 3.84% of OpenClaw’s codebase (about 26k vs 676k lines), so “lightweight” is measurable.

## Why NextClaw?

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Feature-rich** | Multi-provider, multi-channel, cron/heartbeat, web search, exec, memory, subagents — aligned with OpenClaw where it matters. |
| **OpenClaw compatible** | Same plugin SDK and channel plugin format; built-in channel plugins (Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, etc.) are OpenClaw-style and configurable the same way. |
| **Easier to use** | One command (`nextclaw start`), then configure everything in the built-in UI. No complex CLI workflows or separate daemon. |
| **Maintainable** | Runtime capabilities stay focused on built-ins, reducing hidden coupling and long-term maintenance cost. |
| **Lightweight** | Evolved from nanobot; minimal codebase, fast to run and maintain. |

**Best for:** quick trials, secondary machines, or anyone who wants multi-channel and multi-provider with low maintenance overhead.

## Core Capabilities

### One-command start and config UI

- `nextclaw start` — background gateway + config UI (default: http://127.0.0.1:18791, bindable to 0.0.0.0).
- UI tabs: **Models** (default model and parameters), **Providers** (API keys and endpoints), **Channels** (enable and set credentials).

### Multi-provider

OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, MiniMax, Moonshot, Gemini, DeepSeek, DashScope, Zhipu, Groq, vLLM, AiHubMix, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint via `apiBase` and `apiKey`.

### Multi-channel

Telegram, Discord, Slack, Feishu, DingTalk, WeCom, WhatsApp, Email, QQ, Mochat — enable and configure from the UI. Group policies, mentions, and allowlists are supported (OpenClaw-aligned).

### Automation

- **Cron:** one-shot, cron expression, or fixed interval; optional delivery to a channel.
- **Heartbeat:** periodic read of workspace `HEARTBEAT.md` with tasks executed by the agent.

### Built-in tools

File read/write/edit, list directory, `exec`, web search, web fetch, send message, spawn subagent, session list/history/send, memory search, gateway config and ops, cron management, and more.

### Multi-agent and routing

Single process, multiple agents (`agents.list`). Route by channel + accountId (and optionally peer) via `bindings` to different `agentId`. Session isolation with `session.dmScope` (main, per-peer, per-channel-peer, per-account-channel-peer). See [Multi-Agent Routing](/en/guide/multi-agent).

### Plugins and Skills

OpenClaw-format plugins (including channel plugins) from local paths or npm. Skills from ClawHub: `nextclaw skills install <slug>`; workspace `skills/` and context injection. See [Configuration](/en/guide/configuration) and [Commands](/en/guide/commands).

## Architecture (high level)

- **Single gateway process:** channel ingress, routing, sessions, agent pool, tools, and memory in one process for simpler observability and restart.
- **Config:** `~/.nextclaw/config.json`. Many keys (providers, channels, agents.defaults, context, tools) hot-reload without restart.
- **Packages:** `nextclaw` (CLI), `nextclaw-core` (agent loop, providers, tools, cron, session, memory), `nextclaw-server` (HTTP/WebSocket for UI and channels), `nextclaw-ui` (config UI), `nextclaw-openclaw-compat` (plugin SDK), `nextclaw-channel-runtime` and `nextclaw-channel-plugin-*` (channel runtime and plugins).

---

## Quick start

```bash
npm i -g nextclaw
nextclaw start
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:18791** in your browser and set a provider (e.g. OpenRouter) and model. Stop with `nextclaw stop`.
