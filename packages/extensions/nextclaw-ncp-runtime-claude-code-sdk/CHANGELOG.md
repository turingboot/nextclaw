# @nextclaw/nextclaw-ncp-runtime-claude-code-sdk

## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- Ship the full set of current unreleased workspace package changes in one release batch, including the server/CLI updates already sitting in the working tree and the previously committed public package drift that has not been published yet. Republish the NCP agent runtime export surface so NextClaw can resolve `LocalAttachmentStore` after update, and add a release guard that blocks shipping public workspace dependents when a package has drifted past its published tag without a pending changeset.
- Updated dependencies
  - @nextclaw/ncp@0.3.3

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- Disable the default 30s Claude request timeout for real chat turns so long-running Claude sessions are only stopped by explicit aborts or an explicitly configured `requestTimeoutMs`.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- Fix Claude NCP runtime model routing by bridging Anthropic Messages to OpenAI-compatible providers, remove the Claude model whitelist concept, and keep the Claude model selector stable when the previously selected model is missing.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- Republish all public workspace packages with pnpm publish guards so released manifests no longer retain workspace:\* dependencies and future npm publish misuse is blocked before release.
- Updated dependencies
  - @nextclaw/ncp@0.3.2

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix Claude marketplace installs so the bundled Claude Agent SDK CLI path still resolves when the package does not export `./package.json`.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix Claude readiness probing so working Anthropic-compatible routes are not marked unavailable by a probe-only USD budget cap, and improve local first-party plugin loading when running NextClaw from source.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Bundle the Claude runtime entry so published artifacts include all required local modules and the marketplace plugin can be installed successfully from npm.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Add the first Claude-backed NCP runtime and official plugin package so NextClaw can expose Claude sessions through the pluggable runtime registry and marketplace flow.
