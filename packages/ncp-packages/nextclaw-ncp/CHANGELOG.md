# @nextclaw/ncp

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- Ship the full set of current unreleased workspace package changes in one release batch, including the server/CLI updates already sitting in the working tree and the previously committed public package drift that has not been published yet. Republish the NCP agent runtime export surface so NextClaw can resolve `LocalAttachmentStore` after update, and add a release guard that blocks shipping public workspace dependents when a package has drifted past its published tag without a pending changeset.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- Republish all public workspace packages with pnpm publish guards so released manifests no longer retain workspace:\* dependencies and future npm publish misuse is blocked before release.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Republish the NCP-linked package set so published consumers resolve the
  latest NCP protocol/runtime exports used by the current NextClaw CLI build.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Unify the latest NCP native chat chain, runtime capability assembly, chat UI alignment, stream/reasoning/tool fixes, and marketplace metadata publishing into a single minor release.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Refactor the NCP agent backend stack from run-centric semantics to session-centric live execution.
  - Replace run-based stream and abort payloads with `sessionId`-based live session APIs.
  - Rename the manifest capability from `supportsRunStream` to `supportsLiveSessionStream`.
  - Remove run-store/controller abstractions from `@nextclaw/ncp-toolkit` and move active execution ownership into the live session registry.
  - Align the HTTP client/server transports and React hooks with live session streaming.
  - Update `ncp-demo` to use the session-centric backend, add a `sleep` tool, and remove mock LLM mode.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Expose the new NCP agent runtime/backend type exports and session delete API, and add the docs entry under Settings in the main chat sidebar.

## 0.1.0

- Bootstrap package skeleton with NCP protocol types and endpoint base abstractions.
