# @nextclaw/agent-chat-ui

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- Ship the full set of current unreleased workspace package changes in one release batch, including the server/CLI updates already sitting in the working tree and the previously committed public package drift that has not been published yet. Republish the NCP agent runtime export surface so NextClaw can resolve `LocalAttachmentStore` after update, and add a release guard that blocks shipping public workspace dependents when a package has drifted past its published tag without a pending changeset.

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- ee69ef6: Keep pasted and uploaded NCP images in composer order end to end: preserve caret placement, retain image visibility across follow-up turns without hidden model switching, and serialize mixed text/image message parts in the same order users authored them.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- Add NCP image attachment support across the shared chat composer, NCP runtime, React bindings, and bundled NextClaw UI so pasted or uploaded images are sent as NCP file parts and rendered inline. Also keep the required CLI/server/mcp release group in sync for the bundled NextClaw distribution.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- Republish all public workspace packages with pnpm publish guards so released manifests no longer retain workspace:\* dependencies and future npm publish misuse is blocked before release.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Release the tokenized chat composer, IME fixes, and inline skill chip UI improvements.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Unify the latest NCP native chat chain, runtime capability assembly, chat UI alignment, stream/reasoning/tool fixes, and marketplace metadata publishing into a single minor release.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- cfcd97f: Split the reusable chat presentation layer into a standalone `@nextclaw/agent-chat-ui` package and wire `@nextclaw/ui` to consume it.
