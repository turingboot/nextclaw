# @nextclaw/ui

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- Add the Phase 1 Feishu platform foundation for NextClaw, including shared Feishu core primitives, richer message conversion, multi-account routing, and the aligned config UI/runtime release chain.

## 0.9.17

### Patch Changes

- Republish all public workspace packages with pnpm publish guards so released manifests no longer retain workspace:\* dependencies and future npm publish misuse is blocked before release.
- Updated dependencies
  - @nextclaw/agent-chat@0.1.2
  - @nextclaw/agent-chat-ui@0.2.2
  - @nextclaw/ncp@0.3.2
  - @nextclaw/ncp-http-agent-client@0.3.2
  - @nextclaw/ncp-react@0.3.3

## 0.9.16

### Patch Changes

- Republish the verified Weixin QR auth UI flow above already occupied npm versions so the published CLI and UI packages match the code that passed real smoke validation.

## 0.9.15

### Patch Changes

- Publish the transparent app transport boundary fix so local and remote streaming remain a true transport-only replacement.
  - keep SSE and multiplex adapters transport-only instead of interpreting upper-layer terminal events
  - preserve `final` as a normal streamed event while keeping `openStream().finished` stable
  - ship the repaired local chat UX and remote request-multiplex behavior in the released CLI/UI/runtime chain

## 0.9.14

### Patch Changes

- Add the Weixin channel entry to the Channels page so users can configure personal Weixin accounts directly from the frontend.

## 0.9.13

### Patch Changes

- Fix local UI runtime probe fallback so local NextClaw instances keep using local transport
  instead of breaking on `/_remote/runtime` HTML responses.

## 0.9.12

### Patch Changes

- Unify controlled UI requests under appClient, ship the updated built-in UI bundle,
  and keep the CLI release group aligned.

## 0.9.11

### Patch Changes

- Republish the finalized remote app transport multiplex implementation after maintainability refactors so the published packages match the verified runtime code.

## 0.9.10

### Patch Changes

- Add remote app transport multiplexing so the UI can switch from direct local transport to remote runtime transport, including browser-side remote requests, realtime event bridging, and streamed chat turns over the remote relay.

## 0.9.9

### Patch Changes

- Align the default NextClaw UI port to 55667 across core config, remote access, CLI runtime, UI fallbacks, Docker defaults, smoke scripts, and user-facing docs.

## 0.9.8

### Patch Changes

- Add an `enabled` switch for providers so disabled providers stay configured but are excluded from routing, model selection, and runtime diagnostics.

  Expose the provider enabled state through the server and UI config views, and show disabled providers clearly in the Providers page.

## 0.9.7

### Patch Changes

- Align the remote access UI with the existing product style, remove leftover advanced controls from the main flow, expose the device list entry directly, and surface clearer disconnected hints.

## 0.9.6

### Patch Changes

- Publish the user-first NextClaw account and remote access UI changes under a fresh npm version so the registry matches the repo state.

## 0.9.5

### Patch Changes

- Refine remote access into a user-first NextClaw account flow, simplify the remote access page, and align the web console device copy with the new product path.

## 0.9.4

### Patch Changes

- Add browser-based remote access platform authorization so users can log out and re-authorize from the UI without falling back to CLI password entry.

## 0.9.3

### Patch Changes

- Productize remote access in the built-in UI by shipping a dedicated Remote Access page, exposing the supporting server APIs, routing in-page managed-service restart through the shared self-restart coordinator so restart reliably relaunches the service instead of only stopping it, and keeping the required `@nextclaw/mcp` release group aligned with the updated server and CLI packages.

## 0.9.2

### Patch Changes

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

  - remove runtime-specific default-model branching and use a generic session-scoped fallback strategy
  - ship the latest NextClaw UI, server, and CLI cutover fixes together
